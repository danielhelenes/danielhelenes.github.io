            <h1 class="h4 text-center text-uppercase py-5">Our History</h1>
              <p class="mx-auto text-justify mb-0 w-75 pb-5">We started creating websites 10 years ago, but only
                  recently found the real motivation to work with technology. Thruth being told,
                   we donâ€™t find any joy or excitement in coding for no reason. What really matters
                 is the porpose behind what we do. And that's why we started this project.

                 We don't
                 do websites for everyone. We only choose the companies that resignate with us.
                 We also don't take more than one project at a time. We only focus on the one at hand.
                 We want to make a difference to people and businesses we trully believe in. Working
                 with this purpose not only motivates us, but also help us doing the best job we can.

                 In the end, we just want to work with what we love, which,
                 as funny as it may sound, is helping other people work with what they love.
